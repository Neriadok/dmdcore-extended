# Database

For Database management, after some research I found that [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) was one of the best options, so I choose it.

Don't forget to configure ```./server/env/database.json```

MySQL was chosen fot the example because it's free to use, scalable and because I like the reliability relational models offer, but you can configure your sequalize for any other DB Architecture (MongoDB, Postgre, SQLite...).
